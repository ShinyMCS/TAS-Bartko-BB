\section{Pitman \& Morgan Test} 

This test assess the equality of population variances of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ where there are bivariate normally distributed. 
$E(Y_1) = \mu_1$ and $E(Y_2) = \mu_2$, var($Y_1$) =  $\sigma^2_1$ and var($Y_1$) = $\sigma^2_2$. ( $-1 \leq \rho \leq 1)$.

\[ \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 \]

Pitman's test tests for zero correlation between the sums and products.

Correlation between differences and means is a test statistics for the null hypothesis of equal variances given bivariate normality.

\subsection{The Pitman-Morgan Test}

The test of the hypothesis that the variances $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$ are equal, which was devised concurrently by \textit{Pitman} and \textit{Morgan}, 
is based on the correlation of $D$ with $S,$ the coefficient being $ \rho_{DS} = (\sigma^2_1 -\sigma^2_2) / ( \sigma_D \sigma_S ),$ which is zero if, and only
if, $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2.$ Consequently a test of H$''$: $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$ is equivalent to a test of H$''$: $\rho_{DS}=0$ and the test statistic is the familiar {\it t}-test for a correlation coefficient with $(n-2)$ degrees of freedom.
