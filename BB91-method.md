### Regression Based Procedure
- References previous work (BB89 paper)
- Casewise difference regressed on case-wise sums. (D~S)
- F test

#### Hypotheses

Null - equal variance *and* equal means.

Equivalent to regression estimates being zero.

Test for overal equality of means and variances equivalent to test for equal bias and precision of measurement devices.

### Omnibus Test - Advantages
- Exact test at an overall alpha level

- The omnibus test may reject a null hypothesis when neither of the component tests would. (Preferable).
