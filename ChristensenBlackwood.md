### Summary of Paper
- We propose a multivariate linear model for analyzing measurement-device data that follow Grubb's model. 
- The multivariate model generates the well-known regression (multiple correlation) test for equality of device variances. 
- It also yields a new simultaneous test for equality of variances and biases. 
- The multivariate model readily permits testing of interesting sub-hypotheses involving the variances and biases. 
- We examine the power of these tests for one-dimensional hypotheses, compare them to tests proposed by Grubbs, 
and propose generalizations of Grubbs's tests. 
- We also consider extensions of Grubbs's model that allow similar regression and simultaneous tests to be performed.
