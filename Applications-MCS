Application of Procedures.

Bartko (1994) discusses the application of such omnibus procedures (in particular Bradley and Blackwood) as a means 
of assessing the agreement of two methods of measurement, a discipline commonly referred to as Method Comparison 
Studies. In the context of method comparison studies, equivalent precision and a lack of bias between measurements are a 
ncessary condtion for two methods to be in agreement.

A key advancement in the formulation of statistical techniques appropriate for comparing methods of measurement was Bland Altman 86, which progressed some 
earlier ideas (Bland-Altman 83), and has since become ubiquitous in medical literature (in excess of 27,000 
citations at time of writing).

Inter-alia, Bartko (1994) seeks to complement pre-existing method comparison techniques with formal hypothesis tests, and demonstrate how an
omnibus test (i.e. Bradlye and Blackwood) may be used to test agreement, by means of a joint test on bias and precision.
