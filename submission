This manuscript shows how the Bradley-Blackwood test statistic for simultaneously 
testing for equal means and equal variances in a random sample of n pairs (Y1,Y2 ) from a
bivariate normal distribution, can be decomposed into a component associated with
testing the equal variance sub-hypothesis and a component associated with testing for
equality of means given equal variances. 

The principal result is that each of the test statistics for the two sub-hypotheses, F0 and F1 , has an F-distribution with 1 and
(n- 2) degrees of freedom under the respective nulls, and that the Bradley-Blackwood
test statistic Fï€ª is the average of the two, which, under the joint null hypothesis, has an
F-distribution with 2 and (n - 2) degrees of freedom.
